## What is this place?
This site is a collection of my notes and general thoughts.

Notes are added when I discover something new, find that I have searched multiple times for the same solution, or if there's something I want to be able to reference later.


## The technology
The site is hosted on GitHub pages and is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses the theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).

I use GitHub pages because it's 'free' for my usage and works best with my typical workflow patterns.
