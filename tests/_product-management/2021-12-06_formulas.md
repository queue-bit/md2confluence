### AARRR: Startup Metrics for Pirates (Dave McClure)

#### `A`quisition 

Getting people to your product, simple metrics:

- *CTR*: Click-thru Rate for email
- *SEO*: Search Engine Optimization rank
- *SEM*: Search Engine Marketing
- *Views / Impressions*: Product site views and impressions
 
Should include ROI:

- *CAC*: Customer Aquisition Cost (Cost of sales and marketing / new customers), could be argued this belongs in [Activation](#activation) or [Revenue](#revenue)

#### `A`ctivation  

The people you converted to users, at the basic level, the **Conversion Rate**. 

Out of all the people who landed on your website:

- The number of people who converted to users (signups/visits)
- The number of people who completed onboarding (onboarded/visits)

#### `R`etention 

Engagement Metrics, Customer Usage

- *MAU*: Monthly Active Users, the number of users who used the product at least once in the last month
- *WAU*: Weekly Active Users, the number of users who used the product at least once in the last week, not used much
- *DAU*: Daily Active Users, the number of users who used the product at least once in the last day
- *Retention Rate*: Percentage of users at a given time that are still users a certain amount of time later, often using the time periods of D0, D1, D7, and D30 (where D is Days)
- *Churn*: Percentage of users at a given time that are not users a certain amount of time later (inverse of retention rate)

Retention is usually applied to cohorts, select a specific set of users then measure what happens with them over time, the User Retention Curve can be graphed.

Other retention metrics:

- *Time between visits*
- *% of users who visit X times a month*
- *Stickiness*: Average number of days monthly active users use the product (DAU/MAU), the higher the better

#### `R`eferral  

- *NPS*: Net Promoter Score, the percent of promoters minus the percent of detractors in a survey of all or some users on how likely they are to recommend your product on a scale of 1-10. People who rank 0-6 are detractors, 7-8 are passives, 9-10 are promoters.
- *K*: Viral Coefficient, the number of new users an average user generates. The avg number of invites sent multiplied by invitation acceptance rate, the higher the better.
- *VCT*: Viral Cycle Time, how fast new users invite friends.

#### `R`evenue  

- *CPM*: Cost per mille, earnings per 1000 ad impressions or views
- *AOV*: Average Order Value or Cart Size, the average price per purchase
- *ASP*: Average Sale Price
- *Net Sales*: Gross sales minus returns, allowances, and discounts
- *GPM*: Gross Profit Margin = (Net sales – COGS) / Net sales x 100%
