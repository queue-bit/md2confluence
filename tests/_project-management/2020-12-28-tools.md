A list of some of my favorite tools when managing projects.


## Project Management Specific Tools

### Jira

- 

### [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/)

- Commercial Software
- 


### [MS Project](http://www.microsoft.com/project)

- Commercial Software
- Best suited to projects using a waterfall approach in my opinion.
- Calculates budgets based on resource rates and work assigned.
- Illustrates critical path using a Gantt/schedules.
- Highly popular among Project Management practitioners in Construction and still in high usage in technology companies.



### [Leantime](https://leantime.io)

- Open source for self-hosted, paid cloud versions available.
- Developed around Lean principles.
- I have a to-do to test this one out when I have time.

### [ZenTao](https://www.zentao.pm/)

- Open source for self-hosted but functionality is limited, paid cloud versions available.
- Developed around Scrum principles, supports other Agile methodologies as well.
- Baked-in Product Management tools.
- I have a to-do to test this one out when I have time.


## Diagramming Tools


### [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) 

- Open source

- UML drawing using a simple markup language, it's real strength comes from integrations and support in other tools such as VSCode and Confluence. Note that it 
requires GraphViz to be installed for many of the diagram styles.

- Along with typical UML diagrams, PlantUML is also able to generate Gantt and Work Breakdown Structure diagrams. 

- Personal favorite for the ability to do documentation as code.



### [Visio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/visio/flowchart-software)

- Commercial Software

- Point-and-Click / Drag-and-Drop diagramming

- Well polished, user experience is similar to other MS Office applications



### [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/)

- Commercial Software

- Point-and-Click / Drag-and-Drop diagramming

- Integrations with other tools like Confluence (embedded diagrams)



### [Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/index.html)

- Open source

- Web (browser) based, desktop app is available

- Point-and-Click / Drag-and-Drop diagramming

- Integrations with other tools like Confluence (embedded diagrams)

- Very powerful when sharing diagrams as no installation is required


## Documentation Tools



### VS Code

- Free

- Primarily a code editor, however, it has many plugins for working with markdown and markup languages and integrates well with git, making it well suited for writing 
and maintaining documentation as code.



### Confluence

- Commercial

- Wiki software with close integrations to Jira

- Not one of my favorites but it's used in most large businesses



### Github

- Commercial

- I'm including Github in Documentation Tools because it can be an incredible document repository if the team takes the time to learn git source control. Used in 
conjunction with markdown languages and publishing tools/integrations, git can be incredibly useful for versioning control.
